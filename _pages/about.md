I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of California, Davis, in December 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Lifeng Lai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gOhaCfUAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on developing **risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL)** algorithms, with an emphasis on efficiency, sample complexity, and robustness. I also explored risk-sensitive RL in diverse settings, including reward-free frameworks and with human feedback (**RLHF**). 

In Summer 2024, I interned with the Gaming AI team at Microsoft under guidance from [Andrea Trevi√±o Gavito](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-trevino-gavito/) and [Chuyang Ke](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ITt3x3MAAAAJ&hl=en), where I explored state-of-the-art AI techniques to gaming. My work primarily involved leveraging **large language model (LLM) reasoning** and causal analysis to enhance game testing.

I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Information Engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2019. During my undergraduate studies, I collaborated with [Prof. Jiangtao Huangfu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/huangfujt) on a patented invention in China. Our project earned recognition as an Outstanding Graduation Paper.
