I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at UC Davis with guidance from [Prof. Lifeng Lai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gOhaCfUAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests lie in risk-sensitive reinforcement learning, including algorithm efficiency, sample complexity and robustness. In particular, I have developed risk-sensitive RL algorithms based on new risk measures. On the other hand, I have also explored risk-sensitive RL under different setups, including the reward-free framework and with human feedback.

I received the B.E. degree in Information Engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China in 2019.
