I completed my Ph.D. in ECE at UC Davis in Dec 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Lifeng Lai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gOhaCfUAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on **risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL)**, enhancing algorithmic efficiency, sample complexity, and robustness.I also explored risk-sensitive RL in diverse settings, including reward-free frameworks and with human feedback (**RLHF**). During the summer of 2024, I interned with the Gaming AI team at Microsoft, mentored by [Andrea Trevi√±o Gavito](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-trevino-gavito/) and [Chuyang Ke](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ITt3x3MAAAAJ&hl=en). There, I applied **large language model (LLM) reasoning** and **causal analysis** to innovate on AI-driven game testing techniques.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Information Engineering from Zhejiang University, China, in 2019. I collaborated with [Prof. Jiangtao Huangfu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/huangfujt) on integrating **deep learning (DL)** into medical image diagnosis.
