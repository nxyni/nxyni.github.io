Xinyi Ni is currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at UC Davis with guidance from Professor Lifeng Lai. Her current research focuses on proposing risk-sensitive reinforcement learning algorithms and analyzing the convergence as well as sample complexity. She's also interested in developing robust algorithms for reinforcement learning against attack, model uncertainty, etc.

Xinyi Ni received the B.E. degree in Information Science and Electrical Engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China in 2019.
