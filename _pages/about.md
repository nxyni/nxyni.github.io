I am currently a Machine Learning Scientist in industry, with continued interest in academic research. If you have exciting ideas or potential collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out. 

I completed my Ph.D. in ECE at UC Davis in Dec 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Lifeng Lai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gOhaCfUAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on **risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL)**, enhancing algorithmic efficiency, sample complexity, and robustness.I also explored risk-sensitive RL in diverse settings, including reward-free frameworks and with human feedback (**RLHF**). During my internship at Microsoft, I applied **large language model (LLM) reasoning** and **causal analysis** to innovate on AI-driven game testing techniques.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Information Engineering from Zhejiang University, China, in 2019. I collaborated with [Prof. Jiangtao Huangfu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/huangfujt) on integrating **deep learning (DL)** into medical image diagnosis and autonomous driving.
