I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at UC Davis with guidance from [Prof. Lifeng Lai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gOhaCfUAAAAJ&hl=en). My current research focuses on proposing risk-sensitive reinforcement learning algorithms and analyzing the convergence as well as sample complexity. I am also interested in developing robust algorithms for reinforcement learning against attack, model uncertainty, etc.

I received the B.E. degree in Information Engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China in 2019.
